Let me explain why we created `setup.py` and `run.py` and how to use them:

**Why we created these files:**

1. `setup.py`:
- Makes it easier to set up the project
- Automatically creates virtual environment
- Installs all required packages
- Creates the `.env` file template
- Prevents common setup mistakes

2. `run.py`:
- Makes it easier to run the application
- Checks if everything is set up correctly
- Verifies the API key is set
- Starts the Streamlit app

**How to run the project (Step by Step):**

1. **First Time Setup**:
```bash
# Run setup script
python setup.py
```
This will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all required packages
- Create `.env` file

2. **Update API Key**:
- Open the `.env` file
- Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4-turbo-preview
TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

3. **Activate Virtual Environment**:
```bash
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Run the Application**:
```bash
python run.py
```

**What happens when you run the application:**

1. The app will open in your web browser
2. You'll see two text areas:
   - One for your resume
   - One for the job description

3. **To use the app**:
   - Paste your resume in the first text area
   - Paste the job description in the second text area
   - Click "Generate Tailored Content"
   - Wait for the analysis
   - View the results in the tabs:
     - Resume Analysis
     - Job Analysis
     - Cover Letter
     - Fit Evaluation
   - Download the results if needed

**Example Usage**:
1. Start the app:
```bash
python run.py
```

2. In the web interface:
   - Paste your resume
   - Paste a job description
   - Click "Generate Tailored Content"

3. The app will:
   - Analyze your resume
   - Analyze the job description
   - Generate tailored bullet points
   - Create a personalized cover letter
   - Show the fit analysis

Would you like me to show you an example of how to use the app with sample resume and job description data?
